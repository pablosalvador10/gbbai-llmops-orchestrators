  "answer": "When converting DCVI code to DCVS code, there are a few things you should be aware of:\n\n1. Distributed Nature: DCVS is a distributed revision control system, which means that each developer has a complete copy of the codebase on their computer. This allows for easier collaboration and offline work.\n2. Branching and Merging: DCVS enables automatic management of branching and merging, which can be different from the centralized version control systems. It is important to understand how branching and merging work in DCVS to effectively manage code changes.\n3. Performance: DCVS generally speeds up most operations, except for pushing and pulling. It is crucial to consider the performance impact on these operations and plan accordingly.\n4. Codebase History: Unlike centralized version control, DCVS stores the complete codebase history on every developer's computer. This allows for easy access to the full history, but it also means that the size of the codebase can be larger.\n5. Features and Compatibility: DCVS may have specific features and compatibility considerations compared to the original version control system. It is important to understand these differences and ensure compatibility during the conversion process.\n\n(Source: 3)"
