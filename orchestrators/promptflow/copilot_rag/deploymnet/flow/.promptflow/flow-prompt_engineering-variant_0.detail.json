        "answer": "When converting DCVI code to DCVS code, there are a few things you should be aware of:\n\n1. Distributed Nature: DCVS is a distributed revision control system, which means that each developer has a complete copy of the codebase on their computer. This allows for easier collaboration and offline work.\n2. Branching and Merging: DCVS enables automatic management of branching and merging, which can be different from the centralized version control systems. It is important to understand how branching and merging work in DCVS to effectively manage code changes.\n3. Performance: DCVS generally speeds up most operations, except for pushing and pulling. It is crucial to consider the performance impact on these operations and plan accordingly.\n4. Codebase History: Unlike centralized version control, DCVS stores the complete codebase history on every developer's computer. This allows for easy access to the full history, but it also means that the size of the codebase can be larger.\n5. Features and Compatibility: DCVS may have specific features and compatibility considerations compared to the original version control system. It is important to understand these differences and ensure compatibility during the conversion process.\n\n(Source: 3)"

Your role is to determine how well a question aligns with the given context and assign an appropriate score based on this assessment.\n\nEvaluation Metric:\n\n5: The question follows logically from the context provided.\n1: The question contradicts or is logically false given the context.\n2-4: Assign an integer between 2 and 4 if the question's accuracy is ambiguous, or if it's not possible to determine the truth value without additional information. If no such score seems appropriate, default to 1.\nOutput Format:\n\nAfter scoring each context-question pair, return only those with a score above 3. The output should be in a list the context-question pairs that meet the criteria. The output should be in the following format:\n\n1. context1...\n2. context2...\n...\n\nImportant Notes:\n\nEnsure that your evaluation is based solely on the information provided in the context.\nThe presence of symbols or computer-generated elements in the answer should not negatively impact your assessment.\nYour output should include the list of content and context but should not repeat the answer.\n\nRead the passage of information thoroughly and select the correct answer from the three answer labels. Read the CONTEXT thoroughly to ensure you know what the CONTEXT entails.\n\nIndependent Examples:\n\nPlease refer to these examples to understand the evaluation pair and the reason behind the score and relationship between the answer and context. Imitate the same for the question and context pair I am providing to you.\n\n## Example Task #1 Input:\n{\"CONTEXT\": \"The Academy Awards, also known as the Oscars are awards for artistic and technical merit for the film industry.

      "result": "When converting DCVI code to DCVS code, there are a few things you should be aware of:\n\n1. Distributed Nature: DCVS is a distributed revision control system, which means that each developer has a complete copy of the codebase on their computer. This allows for easier collaboration and offline work.\n2. Branching and Merging: DCVS enables automatic management of branching and merging, which can be different from the centralized version control systems. It is important to understand how branching and merging work in DCVS to effectively manage code changes.\n3. Performance: DCVS generally speeds up most operations, except for pushing and pulling. It is crucial to consider the performance impact on these operations and plan accordingly.\n4. Codebase History: Unlike centralized version control, DCVS stores the complete codebase history on every developer's computer. This allows for easy access to the full history, but it also means that the size of the codebase can be larger.\n5. Features and Compatibility: DCVS may have specific features and compatibility considerations compared to the original version control system. It is important to understand these differences and ensure compatibility during the conversion process.\n\n(Source: 3)"
