  "answer": "Testing and debugging the UltraFLEXplus system requires the use of Teradyneâ€™s IG-XL software. This tool has transformed test program development for the UltraFLEX product line. It creates an easy-to-use graphical interface that significantly reduces program development and debugging time. \n\nAs for the language question, the IG-XL software deals effectively with multisite complexity, automatically converting single site test programs to multisite ones. It does not specify a certain programming language because the purpose of IG-XL is to allow engineers to focus on actual testing, rather than writing code for the tester. However, given that Teradyne's TestStudio (another product) is based on Microsoft Windows application development environments, it's likely that a language compatible with Microsoft's ADEs could be used.\n\nIn conclusion, you should use the IG-XL software to debug UltraFLEXplus and the programming language can be any compatible with Microsoft Windows ADEs as long as it lets you focus more on the test than coding. \n\n(Source: https://www.teradyne.com/resources/ig-xl-software/, https://www.teradyne.com/products/ultraflexplus/) ðŸ˜Š"
