  "answer": "When converting DCVI code to DCVS code, there are several things you should be aware of:\n\n1. Distribution: DCVS is a distributed revision control system, which means that the codebase and its history are mirrored on each developer's computer. This differs from DCVI, which is a local version control system. (Source: Context 3)\n\n2. Collaboration: DCVS allows for efficient collaboration among software developers working on locally distributed sites. With DCVI, collaboration may be more limited since it is a local version control system. (Source: Context 1)\n\n3. Version Control System: DCVS is based on the Concurrent Versions System (CVS). Understanding the concepts and functionalities of CVS can help in the conversion process. (Source: Context 1)\n\n4. Compatibility: Ensure that the DCVI code is compatible with DCVS. DCVS is compatible with CVS, so any code that works with CVS should also be compatible with DCVS. (Source: Context 4)\n\n5. Licensing: DCVS, like CVS, is freely distributable under GNU and BSD style licenses. Take note of the licensing requirements when converting the code. (Source: Context 1)\n\nIt is important to note that the information provided is limited to the context and no additional specific details were provided regarding DCVI code or DCVS code."
