        "answer": "When converting DCVI code to DCVS code, there are several things you should be aware of:\n\n1. Distribution: DCVS is a distributed revision control system, which means that the codebase and its history are mirrored on each developer's computer. This differs from DCVI, which is a local version control system. (Source: Context 3)\n\n2. Collaboration: DCVS allows for efficient collaboration among software developers working on locally distributed sites. With DCVI, collaboration may be more limited since it is a local version control system. (Source: Context 1)\n\n3. Version Control System: DCVS is based on the Concurrent Versions System (CVS). Understanding the concepts and functionalities of CVS can help in the conversion process. (Source: Context 1)\n\n4. Compatibility: Ensure that the DCVI code is compatible with DCVS. DCVS is compatible with CVS, so any code that works with CVS should also be compatible with DCVS. (Source: Context 4)\n\n5. Licensing: DCVS, like CVS, is freely distributable under GNU and BSD style licenses. Take note of the licensing requirements when converting the code. (Source: Context 1)\n\nIt is important to note that the information provided is limited to the context and no additional specific details were provided regarding DCVI code or DCVS code."

If no such score seems appropriate, default to 1.\nOutput Format:\n\nAfter scoring each context-question pair in the dictionary, return only those with a score above 3. The output should be in a list the context-question pairs that meet the criteria. The output should be in the following format:\n\n1. [context][score]\n2.

The Great Wall of China is a series of fortifications that were built across the historical northern borders of ancient Chinese states and Imperial China as protection against various nomadic groups from the Eurasian Steppe. Several walls were built from as early as the 7th century BC, with selective stretches later joined together by Qin Shi Huang (220–206 BC), the first emperor of China. Little of the Qin wall remains. Later on, many successive dynasties have built and maintained multiple stretches of border walls. The most well-known sections of the wall were built by the Ming dynasty (1368–1644). Score: 5\n2. The Mona Lisa is a portrait painting by Italian artist Leonardo da Vinci that has been described as 'the best known, the most visited, the most written about, the most sung about, the most parodied work of art in the world'. The painting is thought to be a portrait of Lisa Gherardini, the wife of Francesco del Giocondo, and is in oil on a white Lombardy poplar panel. It had been believed to have been painted between 1503 and 1506; however, Leonardo may have continued working on it as late as 1517.

With DCVI, collaboration may be more limited since it is a local version control system. (Source: Context 1)\n\n3. Version Control System: DCVS is based on the Concurrent Versions System (CVS). Understanding the concepts and functionalities of CVS can help in the conversion process. (Source: Context 1)\n\n4. Compatibility: Ensure that the DCVI code is compatible with DCVS. DCVS is compatible with CVS, so any code that works with CVS should also be compatible with DCVS. (Source: Context 4)\n\n5. Licensing: DCVS, like CVS, is freely distributable under GNU and BSD style licenses. Take note of the licensing requirements when converting the code. (Source: Context 1)\n\nIt is important to note that the information provided is limited to the context and no additional specific details were provided regarding DCVI code or DCVS code."

If no such score seems appropriate, default to 1.\nOutput Format:\n\nAfter scoring each context-question pair in the dictionary, return only those with a score above 3. The output should be in a list the context-question pairs that meet the criteria. The output should be in the following format:\n\n1. [context][score]\n2.

Your role is to determine how well a question aligns with the given context and assign an appropriate score based on this assessment.\n\nEvaluation Metric:\n\n5: The question follows logically from the context provided.\n1: The question contradicts or is logically false given the context.\n2-4: Assign an integer between 2 and 4 if the question's accuracy is ambiguous, or if it's not possible to determine the truth value without additional information. If no such score seems appropriate, default to 1.\nOutput Format:\n\nAfter scoring each context-question pair in the dictionary, return only those with a score above 3. The output should be in a list the context-question pairs that meet the criteria. The output should be in the following format:\n\n1. [context][score]\n2.
