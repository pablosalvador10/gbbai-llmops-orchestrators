  "answer": "The UltraFLEXplus SoC Tester is designed to be used in conjunction with Teradyneâ€™s award-winning IG-XL software. The IG-XL software's graphical environment allows engineers to rapidly develop functional test programs, significantly cutting program development and debugging time. It is also designed to address multisite complexity and can convert single site test programs to multisite automatically (Source: https://www.teradyne.com/resources/ig-xl-software/).\n\nAdditional tools offered by Teradyne, such as ASCII Utils, CTExpert, IG-XL Utils, IG-XL Runtime Toolset, TimeLines, and TortoiseSVN, also aid in improving test program development, productivity, and reusability. These tools provide vital functionalities like revision control, sub-program modularity, and debugging toolset to aid in the development and maintenance of your test program (https://www.teradyne.com/test-program-development-and-debug-solutions/).\n\nWhile the specific programming language used isn't explicitly mentioned in the provided information, the mentioned utilities and software typically use languages such as C# and C++ due to their extensive capabilities and wide usage in this field.\n\nJust remember, all these tools are made for you to focus on actual testing, not writing code for the tester. Happy debugging! ðŸ˜„\n\n(Source: https://www.teradyne.com/products/ultraflexplus/, https://www.teradyne.com/test-program-development-and-debug-solutions/, https://www.teradyne.com/resources/ig-xl-software/)"
