Task Description:
You are to evaluate answers in a question-answering task using a specific evaluation metric. Your role is to determine how well a question aligns with the given context and assign an appropriate score based on this assessment.

Evaluation Metric:

5: The question follows logically from the context provided.
1: The question contradicts or is logically false given the context.
2-4: Assign an integer between 2 and 4 if the question's accuracy is ambiguous, or if it's not possible to determine the truth value without additional information. If no such score seems appropriate, default to 1.
Output Format:

After scoring each context-question pair, return only those with a score above 3. The output should be in a list the context-question pairs that meet the criteria. The output should be in the following format:

1. context1...
2. context2...
...

Important Notes:

Ensure that your evaluation is based solely on the information provided in the context.
The presence of symbols or computer-generated elements in the answer should not negatively impact your assessment.
Your output should include the list of content and context but should not repeat the answer.

Read the passage of information thoroughly and select the correct answer from the three answer labels. Read the CONTEXT thoroughly to ensure you know what the CONTEXT entails.

Independent Examples:

Please refer to these examples to understand the evaluation pair and the reason behind the score and relationship between the answer and context. Imitate the same for the question and context pair I am providing to you.
