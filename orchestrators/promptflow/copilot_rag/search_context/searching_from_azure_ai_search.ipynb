    "## ‚ùó Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Understand Quantitve measure of relevenace \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "+ **NDCG@10**: This metric, standing for Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain at 10, rates a retrieval system's effectiveness in finding and correctly ordering the top 10 documents. The score ranges from 0 to 100, reflecting how closely the system's ordered list matches the ideal order of documents. NDCG@10 is widely used for its balance in evaluating both the precision of results and their proper sequencing.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **NDCG@3**: Similar to NDCG@10, NDCG@3 focuses on the top 3 documents. It's particularly relevant in contexts where the highest accuracy in the topmost results is crucial, like in generative AI applications. This metric scores the system's ability to identify and correctly rank the three most relevant documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ **Recall@50**: This measures the proportion of high-quality documents identified within the top 50 results. It's calculated by counting the number of documents rated as high quality by a scoring prompt and dividing this by the total number of known good documents for a given query. It's a useful metric for assessing the system's ability to retrieve a broad set of relevant documents from a large pool.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### The limitation of semantic search and embeddings \n",
    "\n",
    "+ Limitations of Embedding-Based Search\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Weakness in Keyword Precision: Embedding-based search excels in understanding the overall context and semantic meaning but may falter in accurately identifying specific keywords or phrases.It can miss documents containing exact terms if those terms are not semantically aligned with the rest of the content or query.\n",
    "    + Contextual Misinterpretation: Embeddings can sometimes overgeneralize or misinterpret the context, leading to the retrieval of documents that are broadly relevant but miss specific nuances or details. They might struggle with distinguishing subtle differences in meanings, especially in specialized or technical domains.\n",
    "    - Dependency on Training Data:The effectiveness of embeddings is highly dependent on the data they were trained on. If the training data lacks diversity or depth in certain topics, the embeddings may not capture those areas well.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Limitations of Semantic Search\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Struggles with Synonyms and Paraphrasing:Traditional semantic search methods are often rigid in matching terms. They might not recognize synonyms or different ways of expressing the same idea, limiting their ability to retrieve all relevant documents.\n",
    "    + Limited Understanding of Context:\n",
    "    Semantic search can be effective in finding documents with specific terms but might not fully grasp the broader context or the intent behind a query. This limitation becomes pronounced in complex queries where understanding the context or the relationship between terms is crucial.\n",
    "\n"

  },

   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "## üí° Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Hybrid Search as a Winner: Hybrid search combines keyword and vector search methods, capitalizing on the strengths of both. Keyword search excels in identifying specific terms, while vector search excels in understanding semantic similarities. This combination ensures a more comprehensive and accurate retrieval of documents, making it especially effective for diverse and complex search queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Re-Ranking and L2 in Cognitive Search: The L2 layer in cognitive search improves upon the initial retrieval (L1) results by applying advanced ranking algorithms. It reorders the top documents, focusing on enhancing relevance and contextual accuracy. This is particularly important in scenarios where the initial retrieval might miss subtle nuances. L2 uses more sophisticated techniques, often leveraging deep learning models, to ensure the most relevant results are prioritized. \n",
    "\n",
    "In more detail: The semantic ranker runs the query and documents text simultaneously though transformer models that utilize the cross-attention mechanism to produce a ranker score. The query and document chunk score is calibrated to a range that is consistent across all indexes and queries. A score of 0 represents a very irrelevant chunk, and a score of 4 represents an excellent one. In the chart below, Hybrid + Semantic ranking finds the best content for the LLM at each result set size. "

    "This section covers the implementation of a hybrid search system that combines traditional Azure search with a semantic reranker for improved results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### üìä Implementation of Evaluation Metrics using Scikit-learn\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the `ndcg_score` function from the `sklearn.metrics` module to evaluate our search system. This function calculates the Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG), a commonly used metric for evaluating the quality of a ranked list of items.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from sklearn.metrics import ndcg_score\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "\n",
    "# Sample data: Predicted scores and true relevance scores for a set of documents\n",
    "predicted_scores = np.array([[0.9, 0.8, 0.7, 0.6, 0.5, 0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1, 0.05]])\n",
    "true_relevance = np.array([[1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])  # Assuming binary relevance (1 for relevant, 0 for not relevant)\n",
    "\n",
    "# NDCG@10\n",
    "ndcg_at_10 = ndcg_score(true_relevance, predicted_scores, k=10)\n",
    "print(f\"NDCG@10: {ndcg_at_10}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# NDCG@3\n",
    "ndcg_at_3 = ndcg_score(true_relevance, predicted_scores, k=3)\n",
    "print(f\"NDCG@3: {ndcg_at_3}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Recall@50 - Normally, we'd have 50 documents, but for this example, we'll use the 10 we have\n",
    "relevant_documents_count = np.sum(true_relevance)\n",
    "recall_at_50 = relevant_documents_count / len(true_relevance[0])  # Dividing by total documents (50 ideally)\n",
    "print(f\"Recall@50: {recall_at_50}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### üéØ Evaluation Process\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **üîç Gather Azure Cognitive Search Results**: Retrieve the search results from Azure Cognitive Search.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **üéØ Define Ground Truth Relevance Scores**: Establish a ground truth set of relevance scores for the search results.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **üìà Calculate NDCG@3**: Use the `ndcg_score` function to calculate the NDCG at the 3rd position. This gives us a measure of the quality of the top 3 results.\n",

It is also an extension to the UltraWave24 to provide additional test coverage up to 20 GHz. This frequency band targets devices that have WiFi-6, Cellular 5G, Ultra-wideband, and 5G-NR IF interfaces. Each UltraWaveMX20-D16 provides 16 mmWave ports in the test system with the ability to scale to 64 mmWave ports for high site count testing. The UltraWaveMX8 adds mid-band RF test capabilities to support WiFi-6E & 5G test needs. Adding the MX8 as a 1-slot upgrade to any UltraFLEX system with UltraWave24 extends the frequency range to 7.5GHz. Up to 160 MHz of bandwidth is available for supporting 802.11 modulated tests, and 16 RF ports with 8 channels are provided for high parallelism and efficiency. The MX8 provides industry-leading WiFi-6E test capabilities with faster time to market, higher yields, and lower costs.\n",
